# Designs Patterns 

## Description

This repository will be a container or guideline to work using different design patterns in my favorite programing language **C#**. I hope you can enjoy learning as much as I do.

This repository is divided in three groups:

> ### Creational Design Patterns
>
> + Factory
> + Abstract Factory
> + Prototype
> + Builder
> + Singleton
>
> ### Structural Design Patterns
>
> + Adapter
> 
> ### Behavioral Desing Patterns
>
> Every time I write a new pattern, I will put it here.
